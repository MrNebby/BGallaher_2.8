				<h3>History of Theatre</h3>
				<p>Theatre has been evolving for thousands of years. The root of western theatre is from Greece, with Athens playing a big part in its development. Then the theatre the Greeks were working on was discovered by the Romans who expanded upon the idea. The Romans also ended up spreading theatre west across more of Europe. The spread of theatre continued as did its evolution. Plots and themes became more complex and varied. Companies and groups formed. Famous plays that still have so much meaning and are not completely understood are looked at all over the world. Stories told time and time again written hundreds of years in the past and analyzed by all ages. Theatre is an art that will never be forgotten.</p>
